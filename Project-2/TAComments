Project 2: Correctness
moveAllXsDown fails on some simple cases, for example with the following input:
{
                {'X', 'b', 'c'},
                {'d', 'e'},
                {'f'},
                {'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'}
        }
The output should be {
                {'d', 'b', 'c'},
                {'X', 'e'},
                {'f'},
                {'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'}
        }

Everything else looks great! Good job 😊😎👊🧙‍♂️🙆‍♀️🐸😼☃️🐡🅰️👾🤠

Project 2: Readability
The comments you have are great but you are missing comments for many of your local variables.

Project 2: Testing
Great job! Excellent use of JUnit
