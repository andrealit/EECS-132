No need for comments like /* FIELDS */ in final submission.
For field comments, just focus on a simple English description. For example "yearlyBenefit is double initialized to 0.0" tells exactly what java is doing with "private double yearlyBenefit = 0.0;" but that's not that useful since we can just look at the Java code.
Method comments are appropriate.
Variable naming style looks good.
Code format looks correct.
